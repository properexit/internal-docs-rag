# Internal Documentation Assistant (RAG)

A domain-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for answering
questions over internal software documentation using FastAPI documents.

The system retrieves relevant Markdown documentation using semantic search
and generates grounded answers strictly from the retrieved content.
It is designed as an internal engineering tool with a strong focus on
correctness, explainability, and hallucination control.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Semantic retrieval over Markdown documentation using FAISS
- Conservative answer generation with strict grounding
- Explicit refusal when information is not present in the documentation
- Source attribution for every answer
- Modular ingestion, retrieval, and generation pipeline
- Fully local and reproducible (no paid APIs)

⸻

🎯 Design Philosophy
	•	Retrieval first, generation second
	•	Prefer extraction over abstraction
	•	Fail explicitly instead of hallucinating
	•	Keep the system explainable and debuggable
	•	Optimize for correctness over creativity
